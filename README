Today's task involves setting up a development environment for building a secure and efficient REST API for user authentication, including sign-up and login functionality. Here's a brief overview of the steps involved:

1. **Install Node.js:** Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that enables server-side development. It will be the foundation of your API.

2. **Install Express.js:** Express is a popular Node.js framework for building web applications and APIs. You'll use it to create routes and handle HTTP requests for your authentication endpoints.

3. **Install PostgreSQL:** PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source relational database management system. You'll use it to store user data securely.

4. **Set Up Postman:** Postman is a versatile tool for testing and documenting APIs. It will help you test your API endpoints during development.

5. **Configure Your Development Environment:** Ensure your Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL installations are properly configured and running.

6. **Create REST API:** Develop RESTful API endpoints for user sign-up and login. This includes implementing routes, controllers, and securing endpoints to manage user data and authentication.
